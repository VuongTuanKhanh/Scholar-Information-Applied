That is what motivated me to build a system that allows the relationship between students and the school to be strengthened even when not going to the lecture hall. Allowing attendance at home was proved to be a very practical idea while saving lots of time, increase the rate of interaction during the lessons, and contribute to improving learning joy. This argument is further strengthened when the Covid pandemic happened in early 2020, the world changed, and online learning became a trend, which is a great milestone, marking the correctness of the idea, urges me to turn it into the greatest to serve the world.

### Learning Points
- During more than two years working for a foreign company, I was able to sharpen my teamwork skills, as well as learn a lot of new technologies. With the characteristics of the job, I have to force myself to quickly adapt to the new technologies that my boss requires while strengthening my self-study and problem-solving abilities.

## Career Orientation
Currently, I am studying in parallel at two universities:
- Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology at HCMC University of Education and Technology
- Machine Learning Researcher at FPT University

I am in the sprint to complete both of these certifications. My ambition is to continue pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science in Singapore or Korea.

And to achieve this, I need to improve my foreign language skills. Therefore, my goal is to have an IELTS band of 6.5 within the next two years.

Currently, I am a Lecturer in Web and Computer Science programming at MindX Programming Center. I aim to continue this work as a means to improve my communication skills, gain experience for writing in-depth research papers in the future. Speaking a little more about paper writing, I am currently ambitious to complete an in-depth study on the fundamental mathematical theories serving AI in areas such as Linear Regression and Classification. These studies are still in the process of being finalized, and are expected to be completed by the end of this year. They will be sent to the assessment centers upon completion to ensure that they fully meet the professional requirements and applicability to be recognized as a complete research paper, which can be applied in teaching or research later.

Referring to my current job at the foreign company, I intend to continue keeping it for six more months, and there is a high possibility that this job will be suspended for research purposes. Up to now, I have received offers from many Web programming companies for different positions, mostly Shopify Web Developer. However, I had to refuse all of them as I decided to spend more time on research, as well as try my best to finish my two university degrees as soon as possible.

Recently, I received an invitation from FPT Quy Nhon AI research center as an AI intern for 6 months. I have chosen this to be the next stop on my career path. After I completed both undergraduate programs, I decided to go to work at this institute and use this as the foundation for the next steps in the future.

And as for the AmCham scholarship, I understand that this is the most precious opportunity in my life. With the direction I set out for the future, I will need a lot to be able to cover it for academic purposes. This will be an unquestionably solid luggage for me to pursue my dream of studying abroad in Singapore in the near future. The scholarship will open up the opportunity for me to go faster, or to put it simply, it can help me immediately meet my economic condition to register for the IELTS exam. I understand that this is truly a miracle in my life, and I must seize this opportunity at all costs
